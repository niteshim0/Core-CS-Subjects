# Batch Operating Systems

## Definition
- In the 1970s, batch processing was popular, where similar jobs were grouped and executed together.
- Users submitted jobs to the system, which queued them based on first come first serve.
- Jobs executed sequentially, and users received output after completion.

## Purpose
- Transfer control from one job to another efficiently.
- Resident monitor program managed job execution, improving CPU utilization.

- It contained a small set of programs called the resident monitor that always resided in one part of the main memory. The remaining part is used for servicing jobs.

## Advantages
- Efficient CPU usage due to the resident monitor, reducing idle time between jobs.

## Disadvantages
1. **Starvation**
   - Risk of some jobs not getting executed if one job takes too long.
   - Other jobs starve for resources or wait excessively.

2. **Non-interactive**
   - Unsuitable for jobs requiring user input during execution.
   - User interaction limited, as jobs execute without immediate user input.
