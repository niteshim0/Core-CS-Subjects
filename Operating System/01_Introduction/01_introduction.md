# Operating System Overview
In the Computer System (comprises of Hardware and software), Hardware can only understand machine code (in the form of 0 and 1) which doesn't make any sense to a naive user.
We need a system which can act as an intermediary and manage all the processes and resources present in the system.

## Definition
An Operating System (OS) can be defined or acts as an interface between users and hardware, managing processes and resources to provide a convenient and efficient environment for program execution.

## Goals of an Operating System

### 1. Efficiency
- Optimizes resource utilization, including CPU, memory, and storage.
- Minimizes response time and maximizes throughput.

### 2. Reliability
- Ensures stable and predictable operation of the system.
- Prevents system crashes and data loss through robust error handling mechanisms.

### 3. Security
- Protects system resources from unauthorized access and malicious attacks.
- Implements user authentication, access control, and data encryption.

### 4. Convenience
- Provides user-friendly interfaces for program execution and system management.
- Offers utilities for easy file management, program execution, and configuration.

### 5. Compatibility
- Supports a wide range of hardware and software configurations.
- Ensures interoperability between different applications and devices.

### 6. Scalability
- Handles increasing workloads and resource demands efficiently.
- Scales up or down to accommodate changing system requirements.


## Functions of an Operating System

### 1. Process Management
- Creation, scheduling, and termination of processes.
- Ensures efficient use of CPU and resources.
- Manages process communication and synchronization.

### 2. Process Synchronization
- Coordinates multiple processes to prevent conflicts and ensure data consistency.
- Uses synchronization mechanisms like locks, semaphores, and monitors.
- Prevents race conditions and deadlocks.

### 3. Memory Management
- Allocates and deallocates memory to processes.
- Handles memory protection and sharing.
- Optimizes memory usage through techniques like paging, segmentation, and virtual memory.

### 4. CPU Scheduling
- Determines which process gets access to the CPU and for how long.
- Balances workload among processes.
- Uses scheduling algorithms like FCFS, Round Robin, and Priority Scheduling.

### 5. File Management
- Manages creation, deletion, and manipulation of files and directories.
- Provides file organization and access control.
- Handles file system maintenance and storage allocation.

### 6. Security
- Protects the system from unauthorized access and malicious attacks.
- Implements user authentication and access control mechanisms.
- Ensures data integrity, confidentiality, and availability.
