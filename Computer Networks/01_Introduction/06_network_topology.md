## Network Topology Types

Network topology refers to the layout or structure of a computer network, defining how various nodes (such as computers, servers, routers, etc.) are interconnected and how data flows between them. It determines the physical and logical arrangement of devices, cables, and other components in the network.

### Bus Topology
- All stations connected through a single cable (backbone), sharing communication.
- Data transmission occurs to all stations, with each station checking if the message is addressed to it.
- Uses CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection) access method to avoid collisions.

- **Advantages**:
  - Low-cost cable installation due to simple layout.
  - Supports moderate data speeds.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Extensive cabling required, which can be messy and costly.
  - Troubleshooting is difficult, as locating cable faults is challenging.
  - Vulnerable to signal interference and collisions.

### Ring Topology
- Stations are connected in a closed loop, forming a unidirectional communication path.
- Data travels in one direction, passing from one station to the next until it reaches its destination.
- Implements token passing access method for orderly communication.

- **Advantages**:
  - Efficient troubleshooting due to a clear direction of data flow.
  - Availability of tools for network operation and monitoring.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Troubleshooting can still be challenging in case of a break in the ring.
  - Failure of any station affects the entire network.
  - Reconfiguration can be complex, especially when adding or removing stations.

### Star Topology
- Central hub connects all nodes in the network, with each node having a separate connection to the hub.
- Uses coaxial or RJ-45 cables for connections, with hubs or switches at the central point.

- **Advantages**:
  - Efficient troubleshooting as each node connects directly to the central hub.
  - Network control is straightforward, allowing for easy management and maintenance.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Central point of failure; if the hub fails, all connected nodes lose connectivity.
  - Cable routing can be challenging, especially in large networks with numerous nodes.

### Tree Topology
- Hierarchical structure resembling a tree, with a root node connecting to multiple secondary nodes, which in turn connect to further nodes.
- Supports broadband transmission and is easily expandable by adding new nodes.

- **Advantages**:
  - Supports broadband transmission, making it suitable for high-speed data transfer.
  - Expansion is straightforward, as new nodes can be added to the existing structure.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Troubleshooting complexities increase with the hierarchical structure.
  - Costs associated with broadband devices can be prohibitive for some networks.

### Mesh Topology
- Features redundant connections between nodes, ensuring multiple paths for data transmission.
- Can be fully connected (each node connected to every other node) or partially connected.

- **Advantages**:
  - Reliable communication due to redundancy, with alternative paths available in case of failures.
  - Fast communication as data can take the shortest available path.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - High initial cost due to the extensive cabling and network devices required.
  - Management complexity increases with the number of connections and paths.

### Hybrid Topology
- Combines different topologies to create a customized network structure that meets specific requirements.
- Offers a balance between reliability, scalability, and flexibility.

- **Advantages**:
  - Reliable and scalable network design that can adapt to changing needs.
  - Flexibility in tailoring the topology to suit unique organizational requirements.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Design complexity increases when combining different topologies.
  - Higher infrastructure costs compared to single-topology networks.
