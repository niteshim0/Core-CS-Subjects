**Transmission Modes:**

1. **Simplex Mode:**
   - Unidirectional communication.
   - Data flows in one direction only.
   - Examples: Radio transmission, keyboard, monitor.

   ![Simplex Mode](https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/computer-network/images/transmission-modes-simplex-mode.png)

   - Advantage: Utilizes the entire bandwidth for transmission.
   - Disadvantage: No two-way communication.

2. **Half-Duplex Mode:**
   - Bidirectional communication, but not simultaneous.
   - Devices can send and receive data, but not at the same time.
   - Example: Walkie-talkies.

   ![Half-Duplex Mode](https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/computer-network/images/transmission-modes-half-duplex-mode.png)

   - Advantage: Devices can both send and receive data.
   - Disadvantage: Delays due to waiting for transmission.

3. **Full-Duplex Mode:**
   - Bidirectional communication simultaneously.
   - Devices can send and receive data at the same time.
   - Example: Telephone network.

   - Advantage: Enhanced performance with simultaneous data flow.
   - Disadvantage: Requires dedicated path for optimal capacity utilization.

**Differences:**
| Aspect              | Simplex Mode                | Half-Duplex Mode            | Full-Duplex Mode            |
|---------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Direction           | Unidirectional              | Bidirectional, not simultaneous | Bidirectional, simultaneous |
| Send/Receive        | One-way transmission        | Both send and receive, but not simultaneously | Both send and receive simultaneously |
| Performance         | Lower than half-duplex      | Better than simplex, inferior to full-duplex | Highest among simplex and half-duplex |
| Example             | Radio, keyboard, monitor    | Walkie-Talkies              | Telephone network           |
