# Computer Network Overview

- **Definition**: A computer network is a set of devices (nodes) connected through communication channels (links).
- **Nodes**: Can be computers, printers, or any device capable of sending/receiving data.
- **Communication Channels**: Links connecting nodes, enabling data exchange.

## Distributed Processing

- **Concept**: Task division among multiple computers rather than a single computer handling the entire task.
- **Advantages**:
  - **Security**: Limited user interaction with the system (e.g., ATM access to bank accounts without full database access).
  - **Faster Problem Solving**: Multiple computers solve problems faster than a single machine.
  - **Redundancy**: Multiple computers running the same program enhance security; if one fails, others can take over.

## Types of Computer Networks

- **Simple to Complex**: Networks vary in complexity and are used for resource sharing among devices.
- **Connections**: Can be wired, optical fibers, or optical links.

## Aim of Computer Networks

- **Resource Sharing**: Facilitate interaction and resource sharing among connected devices.

# Major Components of a Computer Network

## NIC (Network Interface Card)
- **Function**: Helps the computer communicate with other devices.
- **Hardware Address**: Used by the data-link layer protocol to identify the system on the network, ensuring data is transferred to the correct destination.

### Types of NIC:
- **Wireless NIC**:
  - Used in modern laptops.
  - Connects using an antenna with radio wave technology.
- **Wired NIC**:
  - Uses cables to transfer data over the medium.

## Hub
- **Function**: Central device that splits network connections into multiple devices.
- **Operation**: When a computer requests information, it sends the request to the Hub, which distributes it to all interconnected computers.

## Switch
- **Function**: Groups devices on a network to transfer data between them.
- **Advantage**: Unlike a hub, it does not broadcast messages over the network. Instead, it sends the message directly to the intended device, ensuring efficient communication from source to destination.

## Cables and Connectors
- **Function**: Transmit communication signals.

### Types of Cables:
- **Twisted Pair Cable**:
  - High-speed cable that transmits data over 1Gbps or more.
- **Coaxial Cable**:
  - Resembles TV installation cable.
  - More expensive than twisted pair cable but provides high data transmission speed.
- **Fibre Optic Cable**:
  - High-speed cable that transmits data using light beams.
  - Provides higher data transmission speed compared to other cables.
  - More expensive and typically installed at the government level.

## Router
- **Function**: Connects LAN to the internet.
- **Usage**: Mainly used to connect distinct networks or the internet to multiple computers.

## Modem
- **Function**: Connects the computer to the internet over existing telephone lines.
- **Integration**: Not integrated with the computer motherboard; it is a separate part installed in the PC slot on the motherboard.


# Uses of Computer Network

## Resource Sharing
- **Function**: Sharing of resources such as programs, printers, and data among users on the network.
- **Advantage**: Users can access resources without needing to be physically close to them.

## Server-Client Model
- **Server**: Central computer used to store information, maintained by the system administrator.
- **Clients**: Machines used to access the information stored on the server remotely.

## Communication Medium
- **Function**: Facilitates communication among users.
- **Example**: Email systems within a company allowing employees to communicate daily.

## E-commerce
- **Function**: Enables businesses to operate over the internet.
- **Example**: Online platforms like Amazon conduct their business over the internet.

## Additional Uses
- **Collaboration**: Enables teamwork and collaborative projects through shared access to files and applications.
- **Remote Access**: Allows users to access their work or data remotely, improving flexibility and productivity.
- **Data Backup and Recovery**: Provides centralized storage for data backups, ensuring data can be recovered in case of a loss.

# Significance of Computer Networks in Day-to-Day Life

## Practical Example: A Day in the Life of an Office Worker

### Morning Routine
1. **Checking Emails**:
   - **Network Usage**: As soon as an office worker starts their day, they check emails on their computer or mobile device.
   - **Significance**: The computer network connects their device to the email server, allowing access to emails from anywhere.

2. **Accessing Shared Calendars**:
   - **Network Usage**: The worker checks the company’s shared calendar to see scheduled meetings and events.
   - **Significance**: The calendar is hosted on a network server, ensuring everyone has the latest schedule updates.

### During Work Hours
3. **Collaborating on Documents**:
   - **Network Usage**: The worker collaborates with colleagues on a shared document using cloud-based applications like Google Docs or Microsoft Office 365.
   - **Significance**: Computer networks enable multiple users to edit and view documents simultaneously in real-time, enhancing productivity and teamwork.

4. **Using VoIP for Communication**:
   - **Network Usage**: The worker makes a call to a remote team member using Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services like Skype or Zoom.
   - **Significance**: The network facilitates voice and video communication over the internet, reducing the need for traditional phone services.

5. **Accessing Company Resources Remotely**:
   - **Network Usage**: The worker accesses important company files stored on a central server via a Virtual Private Network (VPN).
   - **Significance**: VPNs provide secure remote access to the company’s internal network, ensuring data security while allowing flexibility.

### Afternoon Activities
6. **Online Meetings and Webinars**:
   - **Network Usage**: The worker attends an online meeting or webinar to discuss project updates or learn new skills.
   - **Significance**: The network enables real-time video conferencing, connecting participants from different locations without the need for physical travel.

7. **Printing Documents**:
   - **Network Usage**: The worker sends a document to a networked printer located in another part of the office.
   - **Significance**: Network printers allow multiple users to print documents without needing a direct connection to the printer.

### Evening Wrap-Up
8. **Backing Up Data**:
   - **Network Usage**: At the end of the day, the worker backs up their work to a cloud storage service.
   - **Significance**: Cloud networks provide reliable data backup and recovery options, ensuring data safety and accessibility.

### Conclusion
- **Enhanced Communication**: Computer networks improve communication within the company through emails, VoIP, and instant messaging.
- **Increased Collaboration**: Shared access to documents and resources enhances collaboration among team members.
- **Remote Work Flexibility**: Secure remote access to company resources allows employees to work from different locations.
- **Resource Efficiency**: Shared network resources like printers and storage reduce costs and improve efficiency.
- **Data Security and Backup**: Networked backup solutions ensure data is secure and recoverable in case of hardware failures or other issues.
