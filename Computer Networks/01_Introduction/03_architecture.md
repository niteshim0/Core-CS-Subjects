# Computer Network Architecture

## Definition
Computer Network Architecture refers to the physical and logical design of the software, hardware, protocols, and transmission media for data communication. It describes how computers are organized and how tasks are allocated.

## Types of Network Architectures

### 1. Peer-To-Peer (P2P) Network
- **Definition**: A network where all computers are linked with equal privilege and responsibilities for data processing.
- **Usage**: Ideal for small environments (up to 10 computers).
- **Characteristics**:
  - No dedicated server.
  - Special permissions assigned to each computer for resource sharing.
  - Potential issue if a computer with a resource goes down.

#### Advantages:
- **Cost-Effective**: No need for a dedicated server.
- **Independent Operation**: Failure of one computer does not affect others.
- **Easy Setup and Maintenance**: Each computer manages itself.

#### Disadvantages:
- **Lack of Centralization**: No centralized data backup.
- **Security Issues**: Each device manages its own security.

### 2. Client/Server Network
- **Definition**: A network model where end users (clients) access resources from a central computer (server).
- **Characteristics**:
  - Central controller is the server, other computers are clients.
  - Server handles major operations like security and network management.
  - Clients communicate via the server (e.g., for data sharing between clients).

#### Advantages:
- **Centralized System**: Easy data backup.
- **Dedicated Server**: Improves overall performance.
- **Enhanced Security**: Single server administers shared resources.
- **Resource Sharing Speed**: Faster sharing of resources.

#### Disadvantages:
- **Cost**: Requires an expensive server with large memory.
- **Network Operating System (NOS)**: High cost of NOS.
- **Dedicated Administrator**: Needs a network administrator to manage resources.
