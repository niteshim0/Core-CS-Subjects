# Decomposition Patterns

Decomposition patterns are essential for breaking down a monolithic application into smaller, more manageable microservices. These patterns help identify the boundaries and responsibilities of each service, ensuring that each service is cohesive and independently deployable. Here are the key decomposition patterns:

## 1. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**

### **Description:**
Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is an approach to software development that emphasizes understanding the business domain and modeling it accurately in the software. It helps in decomposing a system into microservices based on business capabilities and domain models.

### **Key Concepts:**
- **Bounded Contexts:** Each microservice corresponds to a bounded context, a specific area of the business with well-defined boundaries.
- **Entities and Value Objects:** Model the business domain with entities (objects with identity) and value objects (objects without identity).
- **Aggregates:** Group related entities and value objects into aggregates, which are treated as a single unit for data changes.
- **Domain Events:** Capture significant domain events that other services might need to react to.

### **Benefits:**
- Aligns microservices with business domains, enhancing modularity and maintainability.
- Promotes a clear separation of concerns and reduces coupling between services.

### **Example:**
A retail system could be decomposed into microservices such as Inventory, Order Management, Customer Management, and Payment, each representing a bounded context.

## 2. **Subdomain Decomposition**

### **Description:**
Subdomain decomposition involves breaking down the system based on subdomains within the larger business domain. Each subdomain is implemented as a separate microservice.

### **Key Concepts:**
- **Core Domain:** The most critical part of the business where competitive advantage is derived.
- **Supporting Domain:** Domains that support the core business functions but are not central to the competitive advantage.
- **Generic Domain:** Common domains that are usually not specific to the business but are necessary for operations (e.g., email services, logging).

### **Benefits:**
- Ensures each microservice has a clear business focus, making it easier to manage and evolve.
- Facilitates the assignment of development teams based on business expertise.

### **Example:**
An e-commerce platform could be divided into subdomains like Product Catalog, Order Processing, Customer Service, and Logistics, with each subdomain representing a distinct microservice.

## 3. **Business Capability Decomposition**

### **Description:**
This pattern decomposes the system based on business capabilities, which are the core functions that a business performs. Each business capability is implemented as a separate microservice.

### **Key Concepts:**
- **Business Capability:** A distinct function that a business performs, such as sales, marketing, or customer support.
- **Service Autonomy:** Each microservice operates independently, handling a specific business capability.

### **Benefits:**
- Aligns microservices with the business structure, improving clarity and maintainability.
- Allows independent scaling and development of each business capability.

### **Example:**
A banking system could be decomposed into microservices for Account Management, Transaction Processing, Loan Management, and Customer Support, each representing a business capability.

## 4. **Transactional Decomposition**

### **Description:**
Transactional decomposition involves breaking down the system based on transactional boundaries. Each microservice handles a specific set of transactions and maintains its own transactional consistency.

### **Key Concepts:**
- **Transactional Boundaries:** Define the scope of transactions that a microservice is responsible for.
- **Eventual Consistency:** Achieve consistency across services using eventual consistency mechanisms like sagas or event sourcing.

### **Benefits:**
- Simplifies transaction management within each microservice.
- Reduces the complexity of distributed transactions by limiting the scope of transactions to individual services.

### **Example:**
An online shopping platform might have separate microservices for Cart Management, Order Fulfillment, and Payment Processing, each handling specific transactions.
